      <h3>Holiday Gift Shopping / sort() && map()</h3>
    </header>
    You're online shopping for holiday gifts, but money is tight
    so we need to look at the cheapest items first. 
    Use the built in sort() method to write a function that returns a new array of
    products sorted by price, cheapest to most expensive. 
    <br>
    Then log the item and the price to the console: 
    
    💕,0
    🍬,0.89
    🍫,0.99
    🧁,0.99
    📚,0.99
    ... continued
